# Bankist app

The Bankist app is a fake bank that allows you to see your balance, loan money (calculates your current balance to see how much you can actually loan) and lets you transfer money to other users. The app also have a timeout function that logs you out if not active in X amount of time. We've kept it simple, so users are stored in a object. <a href="https://martinfjeld.github.io/Bankist-app/"><b>You can try it for youself!</b></a> (See user-info below image)
